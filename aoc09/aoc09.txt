The elf you helped yesterday has to go out and place his caches!
He has a path to go on, but he is not sure how long it will take.

Can you calculate the length of the path?

Here is your test input:

0000.0....
...0..0..0
.0.0....0.
0..0.....0
0..00...0.
00..000.0.
0..0..0..0
.0.00.000.
..00....0.
00.0....00



This should give the answer 19.
