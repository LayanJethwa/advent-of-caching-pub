These are the public files for Advent of Caching, a Geocaching series of 25 puzzles I created for Christmas 2024!  
The puzzles are all coding ones, and are based on Eric Wastl's Advent of Code.  
There is also a website for this if you want to try them out yourself: https://advent-of-caching.vercel.app/  
Merry Christmas!  


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
