# Advent of Caching

These are the public files for Advent of Caching, a Geocaching series of 25 puzzles I created for Christmas 2024!

The puzzles are all coding ones, and are based on Eric Wastl's Advent of Code.

There is also a website for this if you want to try them out yourself: https://advent-of-caching.vercel.app/

***Merry Christmas!***
